The Point
===
This script automates the process of creating an `.ogv`, an `.mp4`, and an 
optional `.webm` file for use in particular with the *“Video for Everybody”*
HTML5 approach to web video.

The script will also create an image to use as a *poster* for the video.

Defaults
===
You can set your own default preferences by creating a `.vferc` file and keeping it at `~/.vferc`

You can use the sample file in this repository as a model


Presets

You can also create vfe preset files to handle recurrent patterns of settings

Presets apply after the preferences you set in your `.vferc`
